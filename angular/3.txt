      "mentorSays": "Have you ever wondered how route parameters works in Angular?\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Create an Angular component for: Route Parameters\n// Use @Component decorator\n// Make it standalone\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of route parameters in Angular. You'll need to create a Angular component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Angular best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nRoute Parameters is a fundamental Angular concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Angular applications\n- Following Angular best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Angular teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nGoogle Material uses Angular Router's routerLink directive to navigate between design system sections\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n\n\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING ROUTE_PARAMETERS:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Angular development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Angular pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows Angular best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Angular's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Angular applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Route Parameters component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Angular component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Angular best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Angular patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Angular patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern Angular)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **TypeScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage TypeScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow Angular conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Angular Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Angular conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Angular best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Angular patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern Angular Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern Angular features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern Angular features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Route Parameters in Angular involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Angular concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Angular best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Angular concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this component in a real Angular application?\n3. What Angular patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Angular concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

      "mentorSays": "Have you ever wondered how route guards works in Angular?\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Create an Angular component for: Route Guards\n// Use @Component decorator\n// Make it standalone\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of route guards in Angular. You'll need to create a Angular component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Angular best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nRoute Guards is a fundamental Angular concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Angular applications\n- Following Angular best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Angular teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nGoogle Material uses Angular Router's routerLink directive to navigate between design system sections\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n\n\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING ROUTE_GUARDS:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Angular development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Angular pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows Angular best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Angular's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Angular applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Route Guards component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Angular component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Angular best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Angular patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Angular patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern Angular)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **TypeScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage TypeScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow Angular conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Angular Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Angular conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Angular best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Angular patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern Angular Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern Angular features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern Angular features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Route Guards in Angular involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Angular concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Angular best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Angular concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this component in a real Angular application?\n3. What Angular patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Angular concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

      "mentorSays": "Have you ever wondered how infinite scroll works in Angular?\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Create an Angular component for: Infinite Scroll\n// Use @Component decorator\n// Make it standalone\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of infinite scroll in Angular. You'll need to create a Angular component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Angular best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nInfinite Scroll is a fundamental Angular concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Angular applications\n- Following Angular best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Angular teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nPayPal's checkout button uses Angular event binding (click) to process payments when clicked\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING INFINITE_SCROLL:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Angular development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Angular pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows Angular best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Angular's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Angular applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Infinite Scroll component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Angular component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Angular best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Angular patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Angular patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern Angular)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **TypeScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage TypeScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow Angular conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Angular Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Angular conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Angular best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Angular patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern Angular Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern Angular features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern Angular features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Infinite Scroll in Angular involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Angular concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Angular best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Angular concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this component in a real Angular application?\n3. What Angular patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Angular concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

You'll need to create a Angular component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Angular best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nPagination is a fundamental Angular concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Angular applications\n- Following Angular best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Angular teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nPayPal's checkout button uses Angular event binding (click) to process payments when clicked\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING PAGINATION:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Angular development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Angular pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows Angular best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Angular's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Angular applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Pagination component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Angular component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Angular best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Angular patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Angular patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern Angular)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **TypeScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage TypeScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow Angular conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Angular Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Angular conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Angular best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Angular patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern Angular Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern Angular features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern Angular features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Pagination in Angular involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Angular concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Angular best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Angular concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this component in a real Angular application?\n3. What Angular patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Angular concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

      "mentorSays": "Have you ever wondered how custom directives/pipes works in Angular?\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Create an Angular component for: Custom Directives/Pipes\n// Use @Component decorator\n// Make it standalone\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of custom directives/pipes in Angular. You'll need to create a Angular component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Angular best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nCustom Directives/Pipes is a fundamental Angular concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Angular applications\n- Following Angular best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Angular teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nPayPal's checkout button uses Angular event binding (click) to process payments when clicked\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING CUSTOM_DIRECTIVES/PIPES:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Angular development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Angular pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows Angular best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Angular's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Angular applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Custom Directives/Pipes component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Angular component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Angular best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Angular patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Angular patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern Angular)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **TypeScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage TypeScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow Angular conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Angular Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Angular conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Angular best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Angular patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern Angular Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern Angular features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern Angular features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Custom Directives/Pipes in Angular involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Angular concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Angular best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Angular concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this component in a real Angular application?\n3. What Angular patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Angular concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

This step is crucial for building a complete, functional Angular component.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nThis code importing necessary modules and dependencies. It's the difference between a static page and an interactive, dynamic Angular application.\n\n**What's Happening:**\nWe're importing necessary modules and dependencies following Angular patterns and best practices. This ensures our code is maintainable and follows industry standards.\n\n**Look For:**\nNotice the syntax and how this connects to what we built before. Understanding this helps you read and write Angular code more effectively.",
