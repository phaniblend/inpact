      "mentorSays": "Have you ever wondered how component input works in Angular?\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Child Component\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-user-card',\n  template: '<h3>{{ name }}</h3>'\n})\nexport class UserCardComponent {\n  @Input() name!: string;\n}\n\n// Parent Component\n<app-user-card [name]=\"'John'\" />\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of component input in Angular. You'll need to create a Angular component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Angular best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nComponent Input is a fundamental Angular concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Angular applications\n- Following Angular best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Angular teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nPayPal's checkout button uses Angular event binding (click) to process payments when clicked\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING COMPONENT_INPUT:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Angular development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Angular pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows Angular best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Angular's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Angular applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Component Input component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Angular component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Angular best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Angular best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Angular patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Angular patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern Angular)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **TypeScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage TypeScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow Angular conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Angular Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Angular conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Angular best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Angular patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern Angular Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern Angular features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern Angular features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Component Input in Angular involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Angular concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Angular best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Angular concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this component in a real Angular application?\n3. What Angular patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Angular concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

      "mentorSays": "Perfect! Now let's test your components and make sure everything works correctly.\n\n**Testing Steps:**\n\n1. **Create component files:**\n   - Create `user-card.component.ts` in `src/app/components/`\n   - Create `parent.component.ts` in `src/app/`\n   - Paste the respective component code\n   - Save both files\n\n2. **Import in parent component:**\n   ```typescript\n   import { UserCardComponent } from './components/user-card.component';\n   ```\n\n3. **Use property binding in template:**\n   ```html\n   <app-user-card \n     [name]=\"userName\" \n     [email]=\"userEmail\"\n   ></app-user-card>\n   ```\n\n4. **Run your Angular app:**\n   ```bash\n   ng serve\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify in browser:**\n   - Open http://localhost:4200\n   - You should see the user card with name and email!\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nYour browser should display:\n- A card with \"John Doe\" as the heading\n- The email \"john@example.com\" below it\n- Proper styling (if CSS is added)\n\n**Common Issues and Solutions:**\n\n**Problem 1: Component doesn't appear**\n```\nSymptom: Nothing shows on screen\nSolution: Check that UserCardComponent is in imports array\n         Check that selector matches: 'app-user-card'\n         Verify component is imported correctly\n         Check browser console for errors\n```\n\n**Problem 2: Property binding not working**\n```\nSymptom: Shows empty or undefined values\nSolution: Check square brackets are present: [name] not name\n         Verify @Input() decorator is on property\n         Check property name matches in binding\n         Ensure parent has the data property defined\n```\n\n**Problem 3: TypeScript compilation error**\n```\nSymptom: Red errors in IDE or build fails\nSolution: Check TypeScript types match\n         Verify ! operator for required inputs\n         Check all imports are correct\n         Ensure standalone: true is set\n```\n\n**Problem 4: Template parse error**\n```\nSymptom: Angular template errors\nSolution: Check property binding syntax: [property]=\"value\"\n         Verify template uses backticks for multi-line\n         Check all quotes are matched\n         Ensure component selector is correct\n```\n\n**Problem 5: Data not displaying**\n```\nSymptom: Component renders but shows no data\nSolution: Check interpolation syntax: {{ property }}\n         Verify @Input() property name matches template\n         Check parent is passing data correctly\n         Ensure property is defined in component class\n```\n\n**Try These Experiments:**\n\nOnce it's working, try modifying:\n\n1. **Pass different data:**\n   ```typescript\n   export class ParentComponent {\n     userName = 'Alice Smith';\n     userEmail = 'alice@example.com';\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Add more @Input properties:**\n   ```typescript\n   @Input() age!: number;\n   @Input() phone?: string;\n   ```\n\n3. **Use multiple components:**\n   ```html\n   <app-user-card [name]=\"'John'\" [email]=\"'john@example.com'\"></app-user-card>\n   <app-user-card [name]=\"'Jane'\" [email]=\"'jane@example.com'\"></app-user-card>\n   ```\n\n4. **Bind to object properties:**\n   ```typescript\n   export class ParentComponent {\n     user = { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' };\n   }\n   ```\n   ```html\n   <app-user-card [name]=\"user.name\" [email]=\"user.email\"></app-user-card>\n   ```\n\n5. **Add optional input:**\n   ```typescript\n   @Input() description?: string;\n   ```\n   ```html\n   <p>{{ description || 'No description available' }}</p>\n   ```\n\n**Success Indicators:**\n\n✅ Component renders without errors\n✅ Name and email display correctly\n✅ Property binding works\n✅ Multiple components work independently\n✅ Changes to parent data reflect in child\n✅ No console errors\n✅ TypeScript compiles successfully\n\nYou've successfully created and tested Angular component input communication!",
