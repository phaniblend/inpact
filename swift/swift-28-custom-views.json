      "mentorSays": "Have you ever needed to implement custom views in Swift?\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Create a Swift implementation for: Custom Views\n// Follow Swift best practices\n// Make it production-ready\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of custom views in Swift. You'll need to create a Swift implementation that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following Swift best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nCustom Views is a fundamental Swift concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready Swift applications\n- Following Swift best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in Swift teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nApple's iOS apps use Swift and SwiftUI to build native iPhone and iPad applications. Apps like Mail, Messages, and Photos are built with Swift, providing smooth performance and native iOS integration.\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive applications.\n\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING CUSTOM_VIEWS:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to Swift development. It enables you to build robust, efficient applications that follow industry best practices.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core Swift pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern applications\n- Follows Swift best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding Swift's core concepts, best practices, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world Swift applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Custom Views implementation step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the basic structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic Swift structure with proper imports and setup.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using Swift best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and Swift best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Test and finalize**\nWe'll test the implementation and ensure it's production-ready.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with Swift best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better Swift patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced Swift patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Code Structure**\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n   - Follow Swift conventions\n   - Write maintainable code\n\n2. **Error Handling**\n   - Handle edge cases properly\n   - Provide meaningful error messages\n   - Use appropriate error handling patterns\n   - Validate inputs\n\n3. **Performance**\n   - Optimize for the use case\n   - Consider scalability\n   - Use efficient algorithms\n   - Profile when needed\n\n4. **Testing**\n   - Write unit tests\n   - Test edge cases\n   - Ensure code coverage\n   - Follow testing best practices\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following Swift Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following Swift conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing Swift best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** Swift patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Ignoring Error Handling**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot handling errors or edge cases properly.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nImplementing proper error handling and edge case management.\n\n**Why it matters:** Robust error handling prevents production issues.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Custom Views in Swift involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core Swift concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following Swift best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 45-60 minutes\n**Difficulty level:** Mid\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What Swift concepts do you think we'll need to solve this?\n2. How would you structure this in a real Swift application?\n3. What Swift patterns or best practices come to mind for this challenge?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core Swift concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",
