      "mentorSays": "Perfect! Now let's understand what the Palindrome Linked List problem is asking.\n\n**Problem Definition:**\nGiven the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards\n- We need to check if the list values form a palindrome\n- We can't easily access elements from the end (no random access)\n- We need an efficient approach without using extra space\n\n**Example 1:**\nList: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1\n\nRead forwards: 1, 2, 2, 1\nRead backwards: 1, 2, 2, 1\n\nSame! Answer: true\n\n**Example 2:**\nList: 1 -> 2\n\nRead forwards: 1, 2\nRead backwards: 2, 1\n\nDifferent! Answer: false\n\n**Example 3:**\nList: 1\n\nSingle node is always a palindrome.\nAnswer: true\n\n**Step-by-step trace for Example 1 (Two-pointer approach):**\n\nList: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1\n\nWe'll use a two-step approach:\n1. Find the middle using slow and fast pointers\n2. Reverse the second half\n3. Compare first and second halves\n\n- **Step 1: Find middle**\n  - slow = node(1), fast = node(1)\n  - slow = node(2), fast = node(2)\n  - slow = node(2), fast = node(1) - fast reached end\n  - Middle is at node(2) (second 2)\n\n- **Step 2: Reverse second half**\n  - Second half: 2 -> 1\n  - Reversed: 1 -> 2\n\n- **Step 3: Compare**\n  - First half: 1 -> 2\n  - Second half (reversed): 1 -> 2\n  - Compare: 1 == 1 ✓, 2 == 2 ✓\n  - Palindrome! ✓\n\n**Key Insight:**\nBy reversing the second half, we can compare it with the first half. If they match, it's a palindrome!\n\n**What makes this tricky:**\n1. Finding the middle efficiently (two pointers)\n2. Reversing the second half in-place\n3. Handling odd vs even length lists\n4. Comparing the two halves correctly\n\n**Common pitfalls:**\n- Not handling odd-length lists correctly\n- Not reversing the second half properly\n- Comparing incorrectly (forgetting to skip middle node in odd case)\n- Modifying the original list when we shouldn't (but problem allows it)",
      "example": "Example 1:\nList: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1\nPalindrome: true\n\nExample 2:\nList: 1 -> 2\nPalindrome: false\n\nExample 3:\nList: 1\nPalindrome: true",

Here's the core idea:\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n1. **Find middle**: Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle node\n2. **Reverse second half**: Reverse the second half of the list starting from middle\n3. **Compare halves**: Compare the first half with the reversed second half\n4. **Restore (optional)**: Reverse the second half back to restore original list\n\n**Why it works**:\n- By reversing the second half, we can traverse it backwards\n- Comparing first half with reversed second half checks if it's a palindrome\n- We use O(1) extra space (just pointers)\n\n**Key insight**: We don't need to store the entire list! We can reverse the second half in-place and compare.\n\nLet's trace with list: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1\n\n- **Find middle**:\n  - slow = node(1), fast = node(1)\n  - slow = node(2), fast = node(2)\n  - slow = node(2), fast = node(1) - fast reached end\n  - Middle: node(2) (second 2)\n\n- **Reverse second half**: 2 -> 1 becomes 1 -> 2\n\n- **Compare**:\n  - First: 1 -> 2\n  - Second (reversed): 1 -> 2\n  - 1 == 1 ✓, 2 == 2 ✓\n  - Palindrome! ✓\n\nThis is O(n) time and O(1) space!

      "mentorSays": "🎉 Well done! You've successfully implemented the Palindrome Linked List solution!\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\n- Finding middle: O(n/2) = O(n)\n- Reversing second half: O(n/2) = O(n)\n- Comparing halves: O(n/2) = O(n)\n- Total: O(n) where n is the number of nodes\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n- We only use a constant amount of extra space (pointers)\n- No additional data structures are needed\n- Note: We modify the list in-place (but problem allows it)\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n1. **Two-pointer technique**: Use slow and fast pointers to find middle\n2. **Reverse in-place**: Reverse the second half without extra space\n3. **Compare halves**: Compare first half with reversed second half\n4. **Handle edge cases**: Empty list, single node, odd/even length\n5. **Space efficient**: O(1) space solution (better than array approach)\n\n**Related Practice Problems:**\n- Reverse Linked List (LeetCode #206) - reverse a list\n- Linked List Cycle (LeetCode #141) - detect cycle\n- Remove Nth Node From End (LeetCode #19) - two-pointer technique\n\nKeep practicing linked list problems - they're common in interviews!",
