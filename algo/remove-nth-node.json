      "mentorSays": "Perfect! Now let's understand what the Remove Nth Node From End problem is asking.\n\n**Problem Definition:**\nGiven the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- We need to remove the nth node from the END (not the beginning)\n- We need to update the previous node's next pointer\n- Edge case: removing the head node (n = length of list)\n- We should use a dummy node to handle edge cases\n\n**Example 1:** head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2\n\nRemove the 2nd node from the end (node with value 4).\n\nOriginal: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nAfter removal: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5\n\n**Example 2:** head = [1], n = 1\n\nRemove the 1st node from the end (the only node).\n\nOriginal: 1\nAfter removal: null (empty list)\n\n**Example 3:** head = [1, 2], n = 1\n\nRemove the 1st node from the end (node with value 2).\n\nOriginal: 1 -> 2\nAfter removal: 1\n\n**Step-by-step trace for Example 1 (Two-pointer approach):**\n\nhead = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, n = 2\n\nWe'll use two pointers:\n1. Move first pointer n steps ahead\n2. Then move both pointers together until first reaches end\n3. Second pointer will be at the node before the one to remove\n\n- **Step 1**: Create dummy node, first = dummy, second = dummy\n- **Step 2**: Move first pointer n+1 steps (n=2, so 3 steps)\n  - first = node(3)\n- **Step 3**: Move both pointers until first reaches null\n  - first = node(4), second = node(1)\n  - first = node(5), second = node(2)\n  - first = null, second = node(3) ✓\n- **Step 4**: second.next is the node to remove (node 4)\n  - second.next = second.next.next (skip node 4)\n- **Result**: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 ✓\n\n**Key Insight:**\nBy moving the first pointer n+1 steps ahead, when it reaches the end, the second pointer will be at the node BEFORE the one to remove. This lets us easily update the next pointer!\n\n**What makes this tricky:**\n1. Finding the nth node from the end (need to know the length or use two pointers)\n2. Handling the case where we remove the head node\n3. Using a dummy node to simplify edge cases\n4. The two-pointer technique (fast and slow pointers)\n\n**Common pitfalls:**\n- Not handling the case where n equals the list length (removing head)\n- Off-by-one errors in pointer movement\n- Not using a dummy node (makes head removal complex)\n- Moving pointers incorrectly",

Here's the core idea:\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n1. **Create dummy node**: This simplifies handling the case where we remove the head\n2. **Initialize pointers**: first = dummy, second = dummy\n3. **Move first pointer n+1 steps**: This creates a gap of n nodes between first and second\n4. **Move both pointers together**: Until first reaches null\n5. **Remove node**: second.next is the node to remove, so set second.next = second.next.next\n6. **Return dummy.next**\n\n**Why it works**:\n- By moving first n+1 steps ahead, when first reaches the end, second will be at the node BEFORE the one to remove\n- This gap of n nodes ensures second points to the correct position\n- The dummy node handles the edge case of removing the head\n\n**Key insight**: We want second to point to the node BEFORE the one to remove, so we move first n+1 steps (not n steps)!\n\nLet's trace with head = 1->2->3->4->5, n = 2:\n\n- **Initial**: dummy->1->2->3->4->5, first=dummy, second=dummy\n- **Move first 3 steps**: first = node(3), second = dummy\n- **Move both until first=null**:\n  - first=node(4), second=node(1)\n  - first=node(5), second=node(2)\n  - first=null, second=node(3) ✓\n- **Remove**: second.next (node 4) should be removed\n  - second.next = second.next.next (node 3 now points to node 5)\n- **Result**: 1->2->3->5 ✓\n\nThis is O(n) time and O(1) space!

You've successfully implemented the Remove Nth Node From End solution!\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\n- We traverse the list once with the first pointer\n- Then we traverse the remaining part with both pointers\n- Total: one pass through the list\n- n is the length of the list\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n- We only use a constant amount of extra space (dummy node and two pointers)\n- No additional data structures are needed\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n1. **Two-pointer technique**: Use two pointers with a gap to find the nth node from end\n2. **Dummy node pattern**: Using a dummy node simplifies handling edge cases (removing head)\n3. **Gap of n nodes**: Move first pointer n+1 steps ahead (not n) to position second correctly\n4. **One-pass solution**: More efficient than two-pass (find length, then remove)\n5. **Edge case handling**: Dummy node makes removing the head node the same as removing any other node\n\n**Related Practice Problems:**\n- Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (LeetCode #83)\n- Remove Linked List Elements (LeetCode #203)\n- Delete Node in a Linked List (LeetCode #237)\n\nKeep practicing linked list problems - they're common in interviews!",
