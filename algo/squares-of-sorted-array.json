      "mentorSays": "Perfect! Now let's understand what the Squares of Sorted Array problem is asking.\n\n**Problem Definition:**\nGiven a sorted array of integers (which can include negative numbers), return an array of the squares of each number, sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nSince the original array is sorted, the largest squares will be at the ends (either the most negative or most positive numbers). We can use two pointers to build the result from the end!\n\n**Example 1:** nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]\n\nYour task:\n1. Square each number: [16, 1, 0, 9, 100]\n2. Sort the squares: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]\n\n**Step-by-step trace using two pointers:**\n\nnums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]\nresult = [_, _, _, _, _]\n\n- **Initial**: left=0 (-4, square=16), right=4 (10, square=100), resultIndex=4\n- **Step 1**: Compare 16 and 100 → 100 is larger → Place 100 at result[4], resultIndex=3, right=3\n- **Step 2**: Compare 16 and 9 → 16 is larger → Place 16 at result[3], resultIndex=2, left=1\n- **Step 3**: Compare 1 and 9 → 9 is larger → Place 9 at result[2], resultIndex=1, right=2\n- **Step 4**: Compare 1 and 0 → 1 is larger → Place 1 at result[1], resultIndex=0, left=2\n- **Step 5**: Place 0 at result[0]\n\nResult: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100] ✓\n\n**Example 2:** nums = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]\n\nSquares: [49, 9, 4, 9, 121]\n\nUsing two pointers:\n- **Initial**: left=0 (-7, square=49), right=4 (11, square=121), resultIndex=4\n- **Step 1**: Compare 49 and 121 → 121 is larger → Place 121 at result[4], resultIndex=3, right=3\n- **Step 2**: Compare 49 and 9 → 49 is larger → Place 49 at result[3], resultIndex=2, left=1\n- **Step 3**: Compare 9 and 9 → Equal → Place 9 at result[2], resultIndex=1, right=2\n- **Step 4**: Compare 9 and 4 → 9 is larger → Place 9 at result[1], resultIndex=0, left=2\n- **Step 5**: Place 4 at result[0]\n\nResult: [4, 9, 9, 49, 121] ✓\n\n**What makes this tricky:**\n1. The array is sorted, but after squaring, negative numbers can become larger than positive ones\n2. The largest squares are always at the ends (most negative or most positive)\n3. We need to build the result from the end (largest to smallest) to avoid extra space\n\n**Common pitfalls:**\n- Squaring and then sorting (O(n log n) instead of O(n))\n- Building from the start instead of the end (requires finding the split point)\n- Not handling the case where all numbers are negative or all positive\n- Off-by-one errors when moving pointers",

By building from the end, we place the largest squares first!\n\nLet's trace with nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]:\n\n- **Initial**: left=0, right=4, resultIndex=4\n- **Step 1**: Compare (-4)²=16 and 10²=100 → Place 100 at result[4], resultIndex=3, right=3\n- **Step 2**: Compare (-4)²=16 and 3²=9 → Place 16 at result[3], resultIndex=2, left=1\n- **Step 3**: Compare (-1)²=1 and 3²=9 → Place 9 at result[2], resultIndex=1, right=2\n- **Step 4**: Compare (-1)²=1 and 0²=0 → Place 1 at result[1], resultIndex=0, left=2\n- **Step 5**: Place 0 at result[0]\n- **Result**: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100] ✓\n\nThis is O(n) time and O(n) space!

      "mentorSays": "🎉 Well done! You've learned to think through the Squares of Sorted Array problem. You understand what the problem asks for, how to use two pointers to handle negative numbers efficiently, and how to build the result array from the end.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n1. **Two Pointers from Ends**: Since the array is sorted, the largest squares are at the ends. We compare squares at both ends and place the larger one.\n2. **Build from End**: By building the result from the end (largest to smallest), we avoid needing extra space or finding a split point.\n3. **Handle Negatives**: Negative numbers can have larger squares than positive numbers, so we compare squares, not the original values.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n) - we traverse the array once\n**Space Complexity**: O(n) - we need a result array of size n\n\n**What to practice next:**\n- Merge Sorted Arrays (similar two-pointer technique)\n- Valid Palindrome (two pointers from ends)\n\nThis kind of thinking—using two pointers to build results from the end—is essential for solving many array problems. Keep practicing!",
