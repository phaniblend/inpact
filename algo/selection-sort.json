      "mentorSays": "Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element and placing it at the beginning.\n\n**HOW IT WORKS:**\n\nThe algorithm divides the array into two parts:\n1. **Sorted portion** (at the beginning)\n2. **Unsorted portion** (at the end)\n\nIn each iteration, we find the minimum element in the unsorted portion and swap it with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n\n**EXAMPLE: Detailed Walkthrough**\n\nArray: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n\n**ITERATION 1:**\n- Unsorted: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n- Find minimum: 11 (at index 4)\n- Swap with first element (index 0): [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]\n- Sorted: [11], Unsorted: [25, 12, 22, 64]\n\n**ITERATION 2:**\n- Unsorted: [25, 12, 22, 64]\n- Find minimum: 12 (at index 2)\n- Swap with first element (index 1): [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]\n- Sorted: [11, 12], Unsorted: [25, 22, 64]\n\n**ITERATION 3:**\n- Unsorted: [25, 22, 64]\n- Find minimum: 22 (at index 3)\n- Swap with first element (index 2): [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n- Sorted: [11, 12, 22], Unsorted: [25, 64]\n\n**ITERATION 4:**\n- Unsorted: [25, 64]\n- Find minimum: 25 (at index 3)\n- Already in correct position, no swap needed\n- Sorted: [11, 12, 22, 25], Unsorted: [64]\n\n**ITERATION 5:**\n- Only one element left, already sorted\n- Final: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] ✓\n\n**VISUAL REPRESENTATION:**\n\n[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n ^              ^\n |              |\nsorted      unsorted\n\nAfter iteration 1:\n[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]\n  ✓   ^         ^\nsorted |    unsorted\n\nAfter iteration 2:\n[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]\n  ✓   ✓   ^      ^\nsorted    |  unsorted\n\n...and so on.\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:**\n- Each iteration finds the minimum in unsorted portion\n- Swaps it to the end of sorted portion\n- Sorted portion grows by 1 each iteration\n\n**TIME COMPLEXITY:**\n- Best case: O(n²) - still need to check all elements\n- Average case: O(n²)\n- Worst case: O(n²)\n\n**SPACE COMPLEXITY:** O(1) - in-place sorting\n\n**WHEN TO USE:**\n- Simple to understand and implement\n- Good for small arrays\n- When memory is limited (in-place)",
