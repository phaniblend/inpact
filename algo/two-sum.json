For nums = [3, 3], target = 6, you can use both 3's at different indices: [0, 1].\n\nThat's what the problem wants: return the indices of two numbers that add up to the target.",

Return the indices\n   - If no, store the current number and its index in the hash map\n\n2. **Why this works**: If we've seen a number before, we know its index. When we find its complement, we can immediately return both indices.\n\nLet's trace with nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9:\n\n- **i = 0**: nums[0] = 2\n  - complement = 9 - 2 = 7\n  - Is 7 in map? No (map is empty)\  - Store: map[2] = 0\n  - map = {2: 0}\n\n- **i = 1**: nums[1] = 7\n  - complement = 9 - 7 = 2\n  - Is 2 in map? Yes! map[2] = 0\n  - Found pair!
