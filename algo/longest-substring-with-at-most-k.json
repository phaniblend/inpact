      "mentorSays": "Perfect! Now let's understand what the Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters problem is asking.\n\n**Problem Definition:**\nGiven a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most `k` distinct characters.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- We're finding the longest substring (not subarray)\n- \"At most K\" means we can have 1, 2, ..., or K distinct characters\n- Substrings must be contiguous\n- This is similar to Fruit Into Baskets, but with K instead of 2\n\n**Example 1:** s = \"eceba\", k = 2\n\nWe need to find the longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters.\n\nLet's check substrings:\n- \"ece\" → distinct = {e, c} = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, length = 3\n- \"eceb\" → distinct = {e, c, b} = 3 > 2 ✗\n- \"ceba\" → distinct = {c, e, b} = 3 > 2 ✗\n- \"eba\" → distinct = {e, b, a} = 3 > 2 ✗\n- \"ce\" → distinct = {c, e} = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, length = 2\n\nLongest: \"ece\" (length 3)\n\n**Example 2:** s = \"aa\", k = 1\n\nSubstrings:\n- \"aa\" → distinct = {a} = 1 ≤ 1 ✓, length = 2 ✓\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n**Example 3:** s = \"abaccc\", k = 2\n\nLet's find the longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters:\n- \"aba\" → distinct = {a, b} = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, length = 3\n- \"abac\" → distinct = {a, b, c} = 3 > 2 ✗\n- \"accc\" → distinct = {a, c} = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, length = 4 ✓\n\nAnswer: 4 (substring \"accc\")\n\n**Step-by-step trace for Example 1:**\n\ns = \"eceba\", k = 2\n\nWe'll use a sliding window approach:\n- **right = 0**: char = 'e', map = {e:1}, distinct = 1 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 1\n- **right = 1**: char = 'c', map = {e:1, c:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 2\n- **right = 2**: char = 'e', map = {e:2, c:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 3\n- **right = 3**: char = 'b', map = {e:2, c:1, b:1}, distinct = 3 > 2 ✗, shrink left\n  - **left = 0**: remove 'e', map = {e:1, c:1, b:1}, distinct = 3 > 2, continue\n  - **left = 1**: remove 'c', map = {e:1, b:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 3\n- **right = 4**: char = 'a', map = {e:1, b:1, a:1}, distinct = 3 > 2 ✗, shrink left\n  - **left = 2**: remove 'e', map = {b:1, a:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 3\n\nAnswer: 3\n\n**What makes this tricky:**\n1. Understanding that \"at most K\" means we can have 1 to K distinct characters\n2. When we have K+1 distinct characters, we need to shrink from the left\n3. We need to track character frequencies, not just presence\n4. When a character's frequency reaches 0, remove it from the map\n\n**Common pitfalls:**\n- Not understanding that we need to track frequencies (not just characters)\n- Shrinking incorrectly when we have K+1 distinct characters\n- Not removing characters from the map when frequency reaches 0\n- Off-by-one errors when calculating window size",

      "mentorSays": "Excellent choice! The sliding window approach is both efficient and elegant. Here's the core idea:\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n1. **Use two pointers**: `left` and `right` to define the current window\n2. **Track characters**: Use a hash map to count characters in the current window\n3. **Expand**: Move `right` pointer to expand the window, add character to map\n4. **Check validity**: If we have more than K distinct characters, the window is invalid\n5. **Shrink**: If invalid, move `left` pointer to shrink the window, remove characters until we have ≤ K distinct\n6. **Update maxLen**: Track the maximum valid window size\n\n**Why it works**:\n- We maintain a window with at most K distinct characters\n- When we expand and get K+1 distinct characters, we shrink from the left\n- We remove characters until one character is completely gone (frequency becomes 0)\n- The maximum window size we've seen is our answer\n\n**Key insight**: When we have K+1 distinct characters, we need to remove characters from the left until we're back to K distinct. We do this by decrementing frequencies and removing characters when frequency reaches 0.\n\nLet's trace with s = \"eceba\", k = 2:\n\n- **right = 0**: char = 'e', map = {e:1}, distinct = 1 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 1\n- **right = 1**: char = 'c', map = {e:1, c:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 2\n- **right = 2**: char = 'e', map = {e:2, c:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 3\n- **right = 3**: char = 'b', map = {e:2, c:1, b:1}, distinct = 3 > 2 ✗, shrink left\n  - **left = 0**: remove 'e', map = {e:1, c:1, b:1}, distinct = 3 > 2, continue\n  - **left = 1**: remove 'c', map = {e:1, b:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 3\n- **right = 4**: char = 'a', map = {e:1, b:1, a:1}, distinct = 3 > 2 ✗, shrink left\n  - **left = 2**: remove 'e', map = {b:1, a:1}, distinct = 2 ≤ 2 ✓, maxLen = 3\n\nAnswer: 3\n\nThis is O(n) time and O(K) space (since we only track at most K+1 characters)!
