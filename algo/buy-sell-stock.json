Now let's understand what the Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock problem is asking.\n\nImagine you have an array of stock prices: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]\n\nEach number represents the stock price on that day:\n- Day 0: price = 7\n- Day 1: price = 1\n- Day 2: price = 5\n- Day 3: price = 3\n- Day 4: price = 6\n- Day 5: price = 4\n\nYour task: Find the maximum profit you can make by buying on one day and selling on a later day.\n\n**Rules:**\n- You can only buy once and sell once\n- You must buy before you sell\n- You want the maximum profit possible\n\nLet's explore some options:\n- Buy on day 0 (price=7), sell on day 4 (price=6): profit = 6 - 7 = -1 (loss!)\n- Buy on day 1 (price=1), sell on day 4 (price=6): profit = 6 - 1 = 5 ✓\n- Buy on day 1 (price=1), sell on day 2 (price=5): profit = 5 - 1 = 4\n- Buy on day 3 (price=3), sell on day 4 (price=6): profit = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nMaximum profit: 5 (buy on day 1, sell on day 4)\n\n**Key Insight**: As we scan through the prices, we keep track of the minimum price seen so far. For each day, we calculate the profit if we sell today (current price - minimum price). The maximum of all these profits is our answer.\n\nThat's what the problem wants: the maximum profit from one buy and one sell transaction.",

Our profit variable stays at 0, which is correct!\n\nLet's verify our logic handles this:\n- If prices only decrease, minPrice keeps updating but profit stays 0\n- If prices never go up, we correctly return 0\n\nOur code already handles this perfectly - no changes needed. But it's important to think through edge cases!",

You understand what the problem asks for, how to use a greedy approach to track minimum price and maximum profit, and how to find the maximum profit from one buy and one sell transaction.\n\nThis kind of thinking—using greedy algorithms to make optimal local choices—is essential for solving many optimization problems. Keep practicing!",
