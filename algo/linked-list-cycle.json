Now let's understand what the Linked List Cycle problem is asking.\n\nA cycle in a linked list occurs when a node's next pointer points back to a previous node, creating a loop.\n\n**Example 1 (No Cycle):** 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 -> null\n- Each node points to the next, ending with null\n- No cycle → return false\n\n**Example 2 (Has Cycle):** 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 -> (points back to 2)\n- The list forms a cycle: 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 -> ...\n- Has cycle → return true\n\n**How to detect a cycle:**\nWe use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (also called \"tortoise and hare\"):\n- Use two pointers: slow (moves 1 step) and fast (moves 2 steps)\n- If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer\n- If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach null first\n\n**Step-by-step trace (with cycle):**\n\nList: 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 -> (back to 2)\n\n- **Initial**: slow = 3, fast = 3\n- **Step 1**: slow = 2, fast = 0\n- **Step 2**: slow = 0, fast = 2\n- **Step 3**: slow = -4, fast = -4\n- **They meet!** Cycle detected → return true ✓",

Here's the core idea:\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n1. **Initialize**: slow = head, fast = head\n2. **While fast and fast.next are not null**:\n   - Move slow one step: slow = slow.next\n   - Move fast two steps: fast = fast.next.next\n   - If slow == fast: They met! Cycle detected → return true\n3. **If loop ends**: No cycle found → return false\n\n**Why it works**: If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually \"lap\" the slow pointer and they'll meet. If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach null first.\n\nLet's trace with cycle: 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 -> (back to 2)\n\n- **Initial**: slow = 3, fast = 3\n- **Step 1**: slow = 2, fast = 0\n- **Step 2**: slow = 0, fast = 2\n- **Step 3**: slow = -4, fast = -4\n- **They meet!** Return true ✓\n\nThis is O(n) time and O(1) space!
