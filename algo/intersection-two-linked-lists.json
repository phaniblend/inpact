      "mentorSays": "Perfect! Now let's understand what the Intersection of Two Linked Lists problem is asking.\n\n**Problem Definition:**\nGiven the heads of two singly linked lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Two lists may intersect at some node\n- After intersection, both lists share the same nodes\n- Lists may have different lengths before intersection\n- We need to find the first common node\n\n**Example 1:**\nlistA: 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5\nlistB: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5\n\nIntersection at node with value 8.\nAnswer: node(8)\n\n**Example 2:**\nlistA: 1 -> 2 -> 3\nlistB: 4 -> 5\n\nNo intersection.\nAnswer: null\n\n**Example 3:**\nlistA: 2 -> 6 -> 4\nlistB: 1 -> 5\n\nNo intersection.\nAnswer: null\n\n**Step-by-step trace for Example 1 (Two-pointer approach):**\n\nlistA: 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5 (length 5)\nlistB: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5 (length 6)\n\nWe'll use two pointers:\n1. Find lengths of both lists\n2. Move the longer list's pointer ahead by the difference\n3. Move both pointers together until they meet\n\n- **Step 1**: Find lengths\n  - lenA = 5, lenB = 6\n  - diff = 6 - 5 = 1\n- **Step 2**: Move listB pointer 1 step ahead\n  - ptrA = node(4), ptrB = node(6)\n- **Step 3**: Move both together\n  - ptrA = node(1), ptrB = node(1) - different nodes\n  - ptrA = node(8), ptrB = node(8) - same node! ✓\n\n**Key Insight:**\nBy aligning the starting positions (moving the longer list's pointer ahead), both pointers will reach the intersection at the same time!\n\n**What makes this tricky:**\n1. Lists have different lengths before intersection\n2. Finding the intersection point efficiently\n3. Handling the case where there's no intersection\n4. The two-pointer technique with length adjustment\n\n**Common pitfalls:**\n- Not handling different lengths\n- Comparing node values instead of node references\n- Not handling the no-intersection case\n- Off-by-one errors in pointer movement",

Here's the core idea:\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n1. **Find lengths**: Calculate the length of both lists\n2. **Align pointers**: Move the longer list's pointer ahead by the difference in lengths\n3. **Move together**: Move both pointers one step at a time\n4. **Check intersection**: If pointers point to the same node, that's the intersection\n5. **No intersection**: If we reach the end without meeting, return null\n\n**Why it works**:\n- After aligning, both pointers are the same distance from the intersection\n- Moving together ensures they reach the intersection simultaneously\n- If there's no intersection, both will reach null at the same time\n\n**Key insight**: By aligning the starting positions based on length difference, we ensure both pointers travel the same distance to reach the intersection!\n\nLet's trace with listA (length 5) and listB (length 6):\n\n- **Find lengths**: lenA = 5, lenB = 6, diff = 1\n- **Align**: Move listB pointer 1 step: ptrB = node(6)\n- **Move together**:\n  - ptrA = node(4), ptrB = node(6)\n  - ptrA = node(1), ptrB = node(1) - different nodes\n  - ptrA = node(8), ptrB = node(8) - same node! ✓\n\nThis is O(m+n) time and O(1) space!

You've successfully implemented the Intersection of Two Linked Lists solution!\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(m + n)\n- We traverse both lists once to find lengths: O(m + n)\n- We traverse again to find intersection: O(min(m, n))\n- Total: O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of the lists\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n- We only use a constant amount of extra space (pointers and length variables)\n- No additional data structures are needed\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n1. **Two-pointer technique**: Use pointers to traverse both lists\n2. **Length alignment**: Move the longer list's pointer ahead by the difference\n3. **Move together**: After alignment, both pointers travel the same distance\n4. **Node comparison**: Compare node references (===), not values\n5. **Edge cases**: Handle null lists, no intersection, same node\n\n**Related Practice Problems:**\n- Linked List Cycle (LeetCode #141) - detect cycle in list\n- Linked List Cycle II (LeetCode #142) - find cycle start\n- Remove Nth Node From End (LeetCode #19) - similar two-pointer technique\n\nKeep practicing linked list problems - they're common in interviews!",
