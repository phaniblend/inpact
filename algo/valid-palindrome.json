Now let's understand what the Valid Palindrome problem is asking.\n\nA palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"racecar\" reads the same forwards and backwards → palindrome ✓\n- \"A man a plan a canal Panama\" (ignoring spaces and case) → palindrome ✓\n- \"hello\" reads differently forwards and backwards → NOT a palindrome ✗\n\n**The Problem:**\nGiven a string, determine if it's a palindrome after:\n- Converting to lowercase\n- Removing all non-alphanumeric characters (only keep letters and numbers)\n\n**Example:** s = \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\"\n\n1. Convert to lowercase: \"a man, a plan, a canal: panama\"\n2. Remove non-alphanumeric: \"amanaplanacanalpanama\"\n3. Check if palindrome: reads same forwards and backwards → YES ✓\n\n**How to check:**\n- Use two pointers: one at the start, one at the end\n- Compare characters while moving pointers towards the center\n- If all characters match, it's a palindrome!",

If all match, it's a palindrome!\n\nLet's trace with \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\":\n\n- After cleaning: \"amanaplanacanalpanama\"\n- **left=0 ('a'), right=20 ('a')**: Match ✓, left=1, right=19\n- **left=1 ('m'), right=19 ('m')**: Match ✓, left=2, right=18\n- Continue until left >= right\n- All matched!
