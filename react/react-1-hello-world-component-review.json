Now let's test your component and make sure everything works correctly.\n\n**Testing Steps:**\n\n1. **Save your component:**\n   - Create a file named `HelloWorld.js` in `src/components/`\n   - Paste your component code\n   - Save the file\n\n2. **Import in App.js:**\n   ```javascript\n   import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld';\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the component:**\n   ```javascript\n   function App() {\n     return (\n       <div className=\"App\">\n         <HelloWorld />\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Run your React app:**\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify in browser:**\n   - Open http://localhost:3000\n   - You should see \"Hello World\" displayed!\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nYour browser should display:\n- An h1 heading with \"Hello World\"\n- The paragraphs with \"Welcome to React...\"\n- All elements properly styled\n\n**Common Issues and Solutions:**\n\n**Problem 1: Component doesn't appear**\n```\nSymptom: Nothing shows on screen\nSolution: Check that you exported with 'export default'\n         Check that import path is correct\n         Check component name matches (PascalCase)\n```\n\n**Problem 2: Syntax error in JSX**\n```\nSymptom: Red error in console\nSolution: Make sure all tags are closed: <div></div> or <div />\n         Check for missing closing parenthesis in return\n         Verify all quotes are matched\n```\n\n**Problem 3: Import error**\n```\nSymptom: \"Module not found\"\nSolution: Check file path in import statement\n         Make sure filename matches exactly\n         Check file is in correct directory\n```\n\n**Problem 4: Nothing renders**\n```\nSymptom: Blank screen, no errors\nSolution: Check that function has 'return' statement\n         Verify JSX is wrapped in parentheses for multi-line\n         Make sure you're using the component in App.js\n```\n\n**Try These Experiments:**\n\nOnce it's working, try modifying:\n\n1. **Change the text:**\n   ```javascript\n   <h1>Hello React Developers!</h1>\n   ```\n\n2. **Add more elements:**\n   ```javascript\n   <div>\n     <h1>Hello World</h1>\n     <p>Welcome!</p>\n     <p>This is React.</p>\n     <button>Click Me</button>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the component multiple times:**\n   ```javascript\n   <div>\n     <HelloWorld />\n     <HelloWorld />\n     <HelloWorld />\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n4. **Add CSS classes:**\n   ```javascript\n   <div className=\"hello-container\">\n     <h1 className=\"greeting\">Hello World</h1>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n**Success Indicators:**\n\n✅ Component renders without errors\n✅ All text displays correctly\n✅ Multiple uses of component all work\n✅ Changes to component reflect immediately\n✅ No console errors\n\nYou've successfully created and tested your first React component!",
