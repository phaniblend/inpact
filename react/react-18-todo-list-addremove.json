      "mentorSays": "Have you ever needed to implement a todo list with add/remove in React?\n\n**The Challenge:**\nCreate a todo list component with:\n- Input to add new todos\n- Each todo has a delete button\n- Can't add empty todos\n- Show \"No todos yet\" when list is empty\n- Clear input after adding\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of todo list functionality in React. You'll need to create a React component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following React best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nTodo List is a fundamental React concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready React applications\n- Following React best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in React teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\nAmazon's product list uses map() to render product cards from an array of items. Each product gets its own card component, creating a dynamic, scrollable grid.\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.",
