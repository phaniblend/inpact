Think of imports as gathering the tools we need before we start building. We're following React conventions to ensure our code is maintainable and follows industry standards.\n\n**Think of It Like:**\nIf the template/JSX is the face of your component that users see, this step is building the brain that makes decisions and controls behavior. Just like your brain processes information and decides how to react, this code processes data and controls what users see.\n\n**Look For:**\nThe `import` statements at the top of the file.

You'll need to create a React component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following React best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nLazy Loading with Code Splitting is a fundamental React concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready React applications\n- Following React best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in React teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nPinterest uses lazy loading to load images only when they're about to appear on screen. As you scroll, images load just before they enter the viewport, reducing initial page load time by 60% and saving bandwidth.\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING LAZY_LOADING_WITH_CODE_SPLITTING:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to React development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core React pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows React best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding React's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world React applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Lazy Loading with Code Splitting component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic React component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using React best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and React best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with React best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better React patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced React patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern React)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **JavaScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage JavaScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow React conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following React Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following React conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing React best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** React patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern React Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern React features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern React features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Lazy Loading with Code Splitting in React involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core React concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following React best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What React hooks or patterns do you think we'll need here?\n2. How would you structure this component for reusability?\n3.

You'll need to create a React component that demonstrates these concepts effectively while following React best practices.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nPWA Setup is a fundamental React concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building production-ready React applications\n- Following React best practices and patterns\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in React teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nTwitter uses PWA features to make their web app work offline. When you lose internet, you can still view cached tweets. Service workers cache the app shell, so it loads instantly even on slow connections.\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n\nThis pattern is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING PWA_SETUP:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to React development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core React pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows React best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding React's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world React applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a PWA Setup component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic React component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using React best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and React best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with React best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better React patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced React patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern React)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **JavaScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage JavaScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow React conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following React Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following React conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing React best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** React patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern React Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern React features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern React features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering PWA Setup in React involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core React concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following React best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What React hooks or patterns do you think we'll need here?\n2. How would you structure this component for reusability?\n3. What React best practices would you apply to this solution?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core React concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

This pattern is used extensively in real-world React applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Conditional Rendering component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic React component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using React best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and React best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with React best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better React patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced React patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern React)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **JavaScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage JavaScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow React conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following React Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following React conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing React best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** React patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern React Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern React features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern React features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Conditional Rendering in React involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core React concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following React best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What React hooks or patterns do you think we'll need here?\n2. How would you structure this component for reusability?\n3. What React best practices would you apply to this solution?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core React concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

Learning it properly saves hours of debugging.\n\n**Common Beginner Mistakes:**\n\n❌ **Mistake 1: Not Understanding the Basics**\nMany beginners try to skip learning component fundamentals and jump to advanced topics. This creates gaps in understanding that cause problems later.\n\n✓ **Correct Approach:**\nTake time to understand component thoroughly. Practice with simple examples before moving to complex scenarios.\n\n❌ **Mistake 2: Confusing Similar Concepts**\nBeginners often confuse component with related concepts. This leads to using the wrong approach for the problem.\n\n✓ **Correct Approach:**\nUnderstand the differences between component and related concepts. Know when to use each one.\n\n**Troubleshooting Tip:**\n\nIf you're struggling with component, start with the simplest possible example. Build it step by step, and only add complexity once you understand each part. Read error messages carefully - they often point directly to the issue.\n\n**Real-World Use:**\n\nLinkedIn uses ARIA attributes to make their site accessible to screen readers.

This pattern is used extensively in real-world React applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Theme Switching component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\nWe'll start by creating the basic React component structure with proper imports and decorators.\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature using React best practices.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling, edge cases, and React best practices.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\nWe'll make the component reusable and integrate it into a larger application.\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement with React best practices.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better React patterns.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced React patterns, and comprehensive error handling.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Component Design**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Standalone components (modern React)\n   - Proper separation of concerns\n\n2. **JavaScript**\n   - Use explicit types\n   - Leverage JavaScript's type system\n   - Avoid `any` type\n   - Use interfaces for complex data\n\n3. **Templates/JSX**\n   - Keep templates simple\n   - Use structural directives/components correctly\n   - Use property and event binding correctly\n   - Avoid complex logic in templates\n\n4. **Services/Hooks**\n   - Use dependency injection/custom hooks\n   - Keep services/hooks focused\n   - Separate business logic from components\n   - Follow React conventions\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Not Following React Patterns**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nNot following React conventions and best practices.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nFollowing React best practices and established patterns.\n\n**Why it matters:** React patterns ensure maintainability and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Forgetting Modern React Features**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\nUsing outdated patterns when modern alternatives exist.\n\n✓ **Correct:**\nUsing modern React features like standalone components or hooks.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modern React features are simpler and more maintainable.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\nBasic implementation for simple scenarios that shows the core concept clearly.\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\nTypical implementation used in production apps with error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\nAdvanced implementation for complex requirements with optimizations and best practices.\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Theme Switching in React involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core React concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following React best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases properly\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 5-15 min\n**Difficulty level:** Junior\n\n**Engaging Questions to Consider:**\n1. What React hooks or patterns do you think we'll need here?\n2. How would you structure this component for reusability?\n3. What React best practices would you apply to this solution?\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core React concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",
