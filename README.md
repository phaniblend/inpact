**Free, open-source, Socratic React learning for everyone.**

## What is INPACT?

INPACT is a problem-based React learning engine. Instead of watching videos or reading docs, you build real components — guided by Socratic questioning, instant feedback, and analogous examples.

Every problem is one concept. One concept at a time. No hand-holding, no spoon-feeding — just you, the editor, and the right question at the right moment.

## Problems (so far)

| # | Problem | Concept |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Counter App | useState (number) |
| 02 | Toggle Visibility | useState (boolean) |
| 03 | Controlled Input | useState (string) — coming soon |

## Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Zero runtime AI calls — problems are authored once, served free forever
- Custom syntax-highlighted code editor (no Monaco, no npm bloat)

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inpact-learn
cd inpact-learn
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Philosophy

Most free coding education is passive. INPACT is active.

The engine is open source. The content is free. The goal is to help the next generation of developers — regardless of where they're from or what they can afford.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you want to author a problem, open an issue.
